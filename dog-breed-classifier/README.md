In this project, We create a deep learning model for predicting dog breed. 

We use 2 types of CNN model to build dog breed classifier:
1. CNN model built from scratch
2. CNN model built using transfer learning.

In addition, we also analyse the performance of HaarCascade human face detector and VGG16 dog detector algorithm on our dataset.

Finally, our goal is build a system that takes an input image and returns:
1. Dog breed type if a dog is detected
2. Dog breed a person looks like if a human face is detected
3. Error if something else other than above are found.
